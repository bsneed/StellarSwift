# StellarSwift

Swift Addons for Panic's Nova app.

## Language Server

Currently only supports Swift.  Toolchains chosen via xcode-select are respected.

## Build Tasks

Build commands for Swift Package Manager project.  Two separate task profiles for Running and Testing.
Build failures and issues do currently show up in the `issues` pane.

## Syntax Highlighting

These definitions were provided by Pixel Foundry; A huge debt of gratitude to the team that built that out.

## TODO

- Add Tasks for swift-based scripting.
- Update errors on screen from completion/errors a little less aggressively.
- Add support for xcodebuild.

...

- Figure out how to debug effectively without jumping over to Xcode.
